# **Requirements Definition**

## **Functional Requirements**
- **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system?
The user needs to be able to access and view all of the data from the API, and be able to view the configured dataset. The user should also be able to view errors due to missing data, it should be able to specify whether there is data or not. For example, for an NBA stats database, if the dataset did not include the date-of-birth, then it should say something like N/A, not displaying an error since the information is only unavailable.

- **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?
For the user to interact with the system, there must be at least a command-line interface for the UI, which will allow the user to understand what is happening, and be able to use the application without any bugs or problems. The user should be able to use the UI to connect and interact with the API. The UI should also have the correct formatting, be readable and understandable, and be clear and concise to interact with. The program should also be able to configure the dataset for some sections of the dataset, for example, showing the descending order for a chosen row/column.

- **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system?
The user needs to be able to obtain selected data from the database, the original data from the database, and any error messages or outputs from unavailable data or bugs, as well as the configured/formatted dataset. The user should also be able to obtain a dataset that is configured to their desire, with the rows and columns they want to see to take in the information provided.
## **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform? 

- **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?

- **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?
